# Abstract
This project analyzes Eco Drive Motors’ vehicle sales data to evaluate business performance and sustainability impact in alignment with the UK government’s 2030 carbon reduction goals. Using Power BI, the project examines sales mix across Diesel, Petrol, and Electric vehicles, regional revenue contribution, customer acquisition and retention patterns, profitability by product line, and carbon emissions avoided through low-emission vehicle sales. Insights from this analysis provide actionable recommendations for optimizing sales strategy, improving profitability, and supporting the company’s transition toward environmentally sustainable mobility.
# Background
The automobile industry is shifting toward electric vehicles to reduce carbon emissions. In the UK, transport accounts for about 25% of CO₂ emissions, prompting a ban on new petrol and diesel cars by 2030 and a net-zero target by 2050. While EVs offer zero tailpipe emissions, challenges remain around adoption, infrastructure, and customer acceptance
# Project Statement 
Eco Drive Motors seeks to evaluate its overall business performance while measuring the environmental impact of its vehicle sales in line with the UK government’s 2030 carbon reduction targets. The project focuses on analyzing sales, revenue distribution, customer behavior, profitability, and carbon footprint reduction using Power BI, enabling data-driven decisions that support both commercial growth and sustainability goals
# Challenges
The following are challenges this project aims to solve:

• Profitability vs Sustainability Trade-off
Identifying vehicle types that support carbon-reduction goals while still delivering strong financial performance.

• Uneven Regional Performance
Understanding which regions drive revenue and which require targeted improvement strategies.

• Customer Retention Visibility
Distinguishing between new and repeat customers to assess loyalty and revenue stability.

• Profitability Assessment with Limited Cost Data
Evaluating product-line profitability using maintenance cost as a practical proxy where full cost data is unavailable
# Project Objectives
• Analyze sales mix by vehicle type to identify adoption trends and shifts toward low-emission vehicles

• Assess customer acquisition and retention patterns, including repeat purchases and growth trends

• Estimate carbon footprint reduction achieved through EV and Hybrid sales in relation to 2030 targets

• Measure profitability by product line using gross profit and contribution margin analysis
